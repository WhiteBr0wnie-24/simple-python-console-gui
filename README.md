# simple-python-console-gui
A simple ANSI sequence GUI library for Python.
Note: This is just a quick and dirty library I threw together in one afternoon. I don't recommend using it in production code. However, feel free to add new features or fix bugs to make it better. Its main purpose is to serve as an example for [this accompanying article](https://nerdhut.de/?p=11170).
